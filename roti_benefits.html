        Roti (also known as chapati)[5] is a round flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is commonly consumed in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, and Southeast African countries.

It is made from stoneground whole wheat flour, traditionally known as gehu ka atta, and water that are combined into a dough.[6][7] Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Naan from the Indian subcontinent, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread, as is kulcha. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods
